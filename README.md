## What is Life Message?
Ever felt down some times and thought that you could use a kickup? Well, Life Message is a web application you can use to get advices about life and how your attitude should be towards it. The messages should send a postive vibe towards yourself.

## Technology
This application was made using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The repository may also include other resources such as the image for the website and the jsconfig.json configuration file. The code for the application was written in Visual Studio Code.

## Functionality
The functionality of this application is very simple. When you reach the website, you will see a button to click on, with the image and text shown. Once you click on that button, you will see a message pop up composed of three sentences. The sentences are designed as life advice for you.

## Launching
Now, you must be asking, so how do I come to the website? Well, I have not purchased a domain for this, so you we need to follow the following steps:
1. Place all of the files in a folder in your computer. To do so you would simply have to open a folder in your finder application, and drag the files in a folder. 
2. To open the website, you would have to click on the index.html file. Once you do this, you will see my website. 
This way, you can also be able to use, reference, and/or build from my code which I will allow. If you do use my code on an application of yours, I would ask that you name me as a source.

## Why Did I Make Life Message?
I made Life Message to fufill the Mixed Messages Project from the Codecademy Full Stack Engineer Course. I used the material given to me in the course before I came to this project to make this application, as well as from other websites in the internet.

## How You Can Help
If there is anything you want to suggest or comment please do so. With your suggestions, I will be able to learn and build onto this application. Thank you.
